                Pharuephon ‘’Tum’’ Mukdasanit also known as “Mamafaka” was a Thai 
                graphic designer and street artist. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Mamafaka was born and raised in Khon Kaen. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After finishing a vocational course, he joined Rangsit University, taking up graphic design ‘where he fell in love with art’, according to the Bangkok Post. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                He is best known for one of the 
                most recognizable characters of Thai pop art: ‘MR.HELLYEAH!’ a hairy, 
                one-eyed monster with a mustache.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                His work reflects MAMAFAKA’s remarkably good taste in art, design, and, well, sense of artistic humor. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                MAMAFAKA can be relied upon to bring attention whenever his work is on any product and his following spreads from Thailand to be heard by many brands.

            <p class="para-text">
                
                In 2002, during his course at Rangsit University, Mamafaka met Rukkit Kuanhawate, another graphics designer, and gathered five other design friends to establish a design group called ‘B.O.R.E.D’. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a result, most Thai graphic designers know him as ‘’Mamafaka B.O.R.E.D”. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The group was involved in many events, from the Fat Festival to Tiger Translate, and was influential to street art and pop-cultural enthusiasts in Bangkok, and is still going strong in the graphic industry in Thailand.

            <p class="para-text">
                
                While on holiday in Phuket, Mamfaka reportedly had a surfing accident in Kata beach on the Saturday morning of 7th of September 2013. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                While being unconscious, he was rescued by lifeguards and was rushed to Patong hospital, later on moving to Bangkok Hospital Phuket. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After being in a coma for 48 hours, Mamfaka passed away on Monday, 9th of September 2013. The news was shocking to design and graphic circles all around Thailand. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Mamfaka’s funeral was held at his birth province, Khon Kaen in the North-east of Thailand.
